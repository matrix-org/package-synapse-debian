Template: matrix-synapse/server-name
Type: string
Description: Name of the server
 The name that this homeserver will appear as, to clients and other servers via
 federation. This name should match the SRV record published in DNS.

Template: matrix-synapse/report-stats
Type: boolean
Default: false
Description: Report anonymous stats (yes/no)
 We would really appreciate it if you could help our project out by reporting
 anonymized usage statistics from your homeserver. Only very basic aggregate
 data (e.g. number of users) will be reported, but it helps us to track the
 growth of the Matrix community, and helps us to make Matrix a success, as well
 as to convince other networks that they should peer with us.
 .
 Thank you.
