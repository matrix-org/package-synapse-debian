matrix-synapse (0.34.0-0matrix2) stable; urgency=medium

  The Synapse development team at matrix.org are no longer supporting the
  matrix-synapse package. matrix-synapse 0.34.0-0 is now a transitional package
  which replaces matrix-synapse with our replacement, matrix-synapse-py3.

  See https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/blob/release-v0.34.0/debian/NEWS
  for the differences between matrix-synapse and matrix-synapse-py3, but in
  short, the latter uses Python 3 instead of Python 2.7, and installs Synapse
  into its own virtualenv.
